Assignment: Introduction to Visual Studio
=========================================

This is a lab to introduce you to the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment). In this course we'll use the Enterprise version to explore testing and debugging techniques, but before we can do that you need to know your way around the IDE itself. That's what this lab is for.

If you don't know how to take screenshots, read <https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/> now. If you take screenshots of the entire Visual Studio window, you don't need to crop them. If you take screenshots of your desktop or screen, you *do* need to crop them.

Instructions
------------

Start at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/>, and expand the "Overview" group on the left.

 1. Read through "About Visual Studio". When it gets to "Create a program", follow along in your own copy of the IDE. To prove that you've completed this section, take a screenshot that shows the red dot and highlighted line of code in your IDE, similar to the third-last picture in the instructions.
 2. Read through "About the code editor", and take a screenshot that shows the Rename pop-up box, similar to the last picture in the instructions.
 3. Read through "About projects and solutions", and take a screenshot that shows the run-all-tests results, similar to the last picture in the instructions.
 4. Next, expand the "Quickstarts" group, and work through "C#: Create a web app". Take a screenshot that shows the "About" page of your update app, similar to the last-but-one picture in the instructions.
 5. Finally, work through "C#: Create a console app". Take a screenshot that shows the output pane, similar to the last picture in the instructions.

If you've never used this IDE before, then projects and solutions *will* be confusing, which is why I'm forcing you to look at them at least twice. Don't just skip ahead to get to the final screenshot, because if you do then in future labs you'll be asking me how they work, I'll be saying "RTFM", you won't get points, and neither of us will be happy. Instead, figure it out in *this* lab, and ask me questions now.

Once you've finished those sections, you can explore further in the documentation on your own. I *strongly* recommend bookmarking the entry page as the single best place to start looking for how to do things in Visual Studio. All the tutorials and quickstarts are excellent.

Getting points
-------------

 1. Rename your screenshots as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
 2. Upload them as PNG, JPG, or GIF images to this repo
